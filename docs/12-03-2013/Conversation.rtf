\f0\fs24 \cf0 Thank you for getting back to me.\
\
1. I think it best to show on choose race screen all races on screen and if user moves out then yes show maximum 20 miles.\
\
On screen we need filter at the top to filter through the races and search bar to find races via # so the top bar should have a filter button and a search bar to search. See image.\
\
3. For listing of the races when user taps on the race pin. He needs to be able to go to the race screen by clicking the start button. and see image for what to show in the box. Do not show any reviews. Only the items in the attached image.\
\
2. Youtube will simply be a link that will come from the database. Please make table in db that I can edit myself in phpmyadmin.\
\
4. Display races that user created. YES it is ok to show races that same user created.\'a0\
\
5. Instead of buttons. Use Text and Text will be different color when chosen. Also under the text you will show. You chose A as the correct answer. and you chose "True" as the correct answer before they save. SEE IMAGE.\'a0\
